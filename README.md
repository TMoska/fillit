Algorithm project that uses backtracking technique to find a solution to a smallest possible map, given the tetrimino figures.
Goal is to arrange each tetrimino is such a way that (by priority):

1. Achieve the smallest map size
2. Tetriminos by order are as close to top left corner as possible

Tetriminos are not allowed to be rotated.

This projects has been a part of curriculum for [42 University](https://www.42.us.org) Fillit project.
